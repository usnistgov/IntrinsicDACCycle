# IntrinsicDACCycle

This reopository introduces tools for assessing the performance of sorbent materials for Direct Air Capture (DAC) from a thermodynamic treatment of the refresh cycle and the intrinsic material properties. 

These tools provide the theoretical upper limit of the CO2 captured per energy, and theoretical upper limit on the purity of the captured CO2.

There are also tools to find Pareto optimum refresh cycles for the sorbents.
